She lived in Jiangmei Village, Penghu County (lit.              meaning “speaking the beauty of virtue”) and was temporarily              fostered by the Wu family by request of Qiuwei‘s parents as they              were in the process of moving to Taiwan.

As Qiuwei’s virtuousness came to light,              raised her husband’s four little brothers and one little sister until                        everyone praised her good deeds and she was soon regarded                                                                                                         as a local role model.            their adulthood.","Subsequently, she was awarded               the Model Mother of Penghu County              and the only Model Daughter-in-Law               of Penghu awarded by the Taiwan               Provincial Government.

She continues to be considered a role               model for typical Penghu women.               From her old residence, we can tell              how Aunt Wei worked hard in poverty               and adhered to feminist ethics, being               an inspiration to many.","The Story of                      Uncle Chen                        This is the story about Uncle               Chen, who treated Gangwei (name lit.               meaning the outer harbor end) folks               stranded in Magong kindly.
